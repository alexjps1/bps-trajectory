Motivation
    Point cloud data is everywhere, for example car and drone sensors  (LIDAR)

    But Point Cloud Data:
        • Do not have a fixed cardinality
        • Are not registered (it is not trivial to bring two scans of the same scene into spatial alignment)
        • Have no notion of neighbourhood (Convolution is not possible)
        • Are not ordered

    --> use Basis Point Sets as encoding:
        • Variable number of elements
        • Registered (for grid as basis)
        • Clear neighbourhood
        • Ordered
        
        
    This Project explores BPS as encoding for motion planning tasks, including four main experiments.

    Static Objects:
        1. It investigates how well a scene can be reconstructed from a BPS encoding using CNNs and classical geometric reconstruction techniques.
        2. How well does a RL agent that was trained on full occupancy grids perform on reconstructed scenes?
        
    Dynamic Objects:
        3. How well can a LSTMs predict future dynamic scenes?
        4. Compared to LSTMs that predict the future BPS, which is then decoded to a future scene?
